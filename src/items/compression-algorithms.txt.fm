description: "A compression algorithm can be thought of simply as a function $: F \\to F$ over the set of files $F$. Under this interpretation, lossless algorihms are bijective functions. Though a lossless algorithm cannot compress every file, we usually don't actually care about compressing every file; because of this, there are clever ways to reach desired behaviour."
